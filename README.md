# Python code about solar wind data analisys of SOHO and Wind probes and applications in electric solar sails :)

The modular structure actually is in proccess; this organization is divided in two high blocks: Backend and Frontend.
- **Backend** are the codes about libraries, file access, preproccessing (e.g. .parquet extension file creation), proccessing (filter development and optimization),  and             using (e.g. code of the equations of he electrical solar sails dynamics).
- **Frontend** are the codes that are seen by the user, such as storage (e.g. creation of the filters columns), the of the filters (e.g. comparisons) and dynamics (e.g.              acceleration) plots
